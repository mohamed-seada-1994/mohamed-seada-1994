# Mohamed seada [@mseada94](https://github.com/mseada94)

Hi, I'm Mohamed Seada

I used to have [@mohamed-seada-1994](https://github.com/mohamed-seada-1994) as my GitHub username which is too long.
<br> I renamed my main account username to [@mseada94](https://github.com/mseada94).

I have some code samples most of them for some university labs.
<br/> I made forks for my repos here so any links or references won't break.
